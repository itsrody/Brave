# configparser is part of the Python standard library for versions 3.2+
# If you need to support older Python versions or want to be explicit, you can add it.
# For this project, assuming Python 3.7+ as used by GitHub Actions default images.

# Add other dependencies if your validator/translator grows to need them, e.g.:
# PyYAML  # If you switch config.ini to config.yaml
